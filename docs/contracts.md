# Contracts

Contracts are optional pre and post conditions checks that the compiler may use for optimization and runtime checks. Note that _compilers are not obliged to process pre and post conditions at all_. However, violating either pre or post conditions is considered undefined behaviour, so a compiler may optimize as if they always hold â€“ even if a potential bug may cause them to be violated.

# Pre conditions

Pre conditions are usually used to validate incoming arguments. Each condition must be an expression that can be evaluated to a boolean. A pre condition use the `@require` annotation.

```
/**
 * @require foo > 0, foo < 1000
 **/
fn int testFoo(int foo)
{
    return foo * 10;
}
```

# Post conditions

Post conditions are evaluated to make checks on the resulting state after passing through the function.
The post condition uses the `@ensure` annotation. Where `return` is used to represent the return value from the function. 


    
```
/**
 * @require foo != null
 * @ensure return > foo.x
 **/
fn uint checkFoo(Foo* foo)
{
    uint y = abs(foo.x) + 1;
    // If we had row: foo.x = 0, then this would be a compile time error.
    return y * abs(foo.x);
}
```

## Parameter annotations

`@param` supports `[in]` `[out]` and `[inout]`. These are only applicable
for pointer arguments. `[in]` disallows writing to the variable,
`[out]` disallows reading from the variable. Without an annotation,
pointers may both be read from and written to without checks. 

| Type        | readable?    | writable?   | use as "in"? | use as "out"? | use as "inout"
| ------      | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----:       | :----: |
| no annotation| Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes          |  Yes   |
| `in`        | Yes     | No      | Yes     | Yes          |  No    |
| `out`       | No      | Yes     | No      | No           |  No    |
| `inout`     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes          |  Yes   |


However, it should be noted that the compiler might not detect whether the annotation is correct or not! This program might compile, but will behave strangely:

```
fn void badFunc(int* i)
{
    *i = 2;
}

/**
 * @param [in] i
 */
fn void lyingFunc(int* i)
{
    badFunc(i); // The compiler might not check this!
}

fn void test()
{
    int a = 1;
    lyingFunc(&a);
    printf("%d", a); // Might print 1!
}
```

However, compilers will usually detect this:
```

/**
 * @param [in] i
 */
fn void badFunc(int* i)
{
    *i = 2; // <- Compiler error: cannot write to "in" parameter
}
```

### Pure in detail

The `pure` annotation allows a program to make assumtions in regards of how the function treats global variables. Unlike for `const`, a pure function is not allowed to call a function which is known to be impure.

However, just like for `const` the compiler might not detect whether the annotation is correct or not! This program might compile, but will behave strangely:

```
int i = 0;

type Secretfn fn void();

fn void badFunc()
{
    i = 2;
}

Secretfn foo = nil;

/**
 * @pure
 */
fn void lyingFunc()
{
    SecretFunc(); // The compiler cannot reason about this!
}

fn void test()
{
    foo = &badFunc;
    i = 1;
    lyingFunc();
    printf("%d", a); // Might print 1!
}
```

However, compilers will usually detect this:

```
int i = 0;

fn void badFunc()
{
    i = 2;
}

/**
 * @pure
 */
fn void lyingFunc()
{
    badFunc(); // Error! Calling an impure function
}
```

Consequently circumventing "pure" annotations is undefined behaviour.


# Pre conditions for macros

Macros have an additional class of pre conditions, that are used to confirm that the values actually will work inside the macro body. 
This improves the error messages, since otherwise it would be hard to know if the error is in the implementation of the macro, or in the parameters. These are placed under the `@checked` annotation. 

```
/**
 * @checked resource.open()
 * @require resource != nil
 * @checked void *x = resource.open()
 **/
macro openResource(resource)
{
    return resource.open();
}
```
