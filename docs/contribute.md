Currently C3 is being *designed* it means that there is no complete compiler yet. If you'd like to contribute:

- Discuss the language on the r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord https://discord.gg/RczBvt 
- Suggest improvements by filing an issue: https://github.com/c3lang/c3docs/issues/new
- Offer to work on the compiler being written here: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c
