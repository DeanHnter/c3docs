### What is C3?

C3 a systems language based on C. It intends tries to be a short step up from C rather than to replace it with a new paradigm or completely new syntax. 

Note that C3 borrows heavily from the [C2 lang project](http://www.c2lang.org/) by [Bas van den Berg](https://github.com/bvdberg), but differs in its more far reaching changes to macros, generics, strings and containers.

##### Planned features

- Transpile to C
- Transpile-compile using Clang, GCC or TCC
- Compile directly using LLVM
- C to C3 compilation (for a subset of C)
- Module system
- Generic modules
- Zero overhead errors
- Struct subtyping
- Built-in safe arrays
- High level containers and string handling
