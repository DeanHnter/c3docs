# Setup

C3 has precompiled binaries for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu. 
For other platforms it should be possible to compile it on any platform LLVM can compile to. You will need CMake installed.

## 1. Install LLVM

See LLVM the [LLVM documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) on how to set up LLVM for development. On MacOS, installing through Homebrew works fine.
Using apt-get on Linux should work fine as well. For Windows you can download suitable pre-compiled LLVM binaries
from https://github.com/c3lang/win-llvm

## 2. Clone the C3 compiler source code from Github

This should be as simple as doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/c3lang/c3c.git
```

... from the command line.

## 3. Build the compiler

Create the build directory:

```
MyMachine:c3c$ mkdir build
MyMachine:c3c$ cd build/
```

Use CMake to set up:

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ cmake ../
```

Build the compiler:

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ make
```

## 4. Test it out

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ ./c3c compile-run ../resources/testfragments/helloworld.c3
```
