C3 offers 2 built-in types of arrays: Fixed arrays <type>[<size>] e.g. int[4] . These are treated as values and will be copied if given as parameter. Unlike C, the number is part of its type. Taking a pointer to a fixed array will create a pointer to a fixed array, e.g. int[4]* . Unlike C, fixed arrays do not decay into pointers, instead an int[4]* may be implicitly converted into an int* . // C int foo(int *a) { ... } int x[3] = { 1, 2, 3 }; foo(x); // C3 fn int foo(int *a) { ... } int x[3] = { 1, 2, 3 }; foo(&x); When you want to initialize a fixed array without specififying the size, use the [*] array syntax: int[3] a = { 1, 2, 3 }; int[*] b = { 4, 5, 6 }; // Type inferred to be int[3] Subarray The final type is the subarray <type>[] e.g. int[] . A subarray is a view into either a fixed or variable array. Internally it is represented as a struct containing a pointer and a size. Both fixed and variable arrays may be converted into slices, and slices may be implicitly converted to pointers: int[4] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4}; int[] b = &a; // Implicit conversion is always ok. int[4] c = (int[4])b; // Will copy the value of b into c. int[4]* d = (int[4])a; // Equivalent to d = &a b.size; // Returns 4 e += 1; int* f = b; // Equivalent to e = &a f = d; // implicit conversion ok. Slicing arrays It's possible to use a range syntax to create subarrays from pointers, arrays, vararrays and other subarrays. The usual syntax is arr[<start index>..<end index>] . The end index is included in the final result. int[5] a = { 1, 20, 50, 100, 200 }; int[] b = a[0..4]; // The whole array as a slice. int[] c = a[1..2]; // { 20, 50 } It's possible to omit the first and last index, in which case the start and the len is inferred. Note that omitting the last index is not allowed for pointers. The following are all equivalent: int[5] a = { 1, 20, 50, 100, 200 }; int[] b = a[0..4]; int[] c = a[..4]; int[] d = a[0..]; int[] e = a[..]; One may also slice from the end. Again this is not allowed for pointers. int[5] a = { 1, 20, 50, 100, 200 }; int[] b = a[1..^2]; // { 20, 50, 100 } int[] c = a[^3..]; // { 50, 100, 200 } One may also use assign to slices: int[3] a = { 1, 20, 50 }; a[1..2] = 0; // a = { 1, 0, 0} Or copy slices to slices: int[3] a = { 1, 20, 50 }; int[3] b = { 2, 4, 5 } a[1..2] = b[0..1]; // a = { 1, 2, 4} Copying overlapping ranges, e.g. a[1..2] = a[0..1] is undefined behaviour. Conversion list int[4] int[] int[4]* int* int[4] copy - - - int[] - assign assign - int[4]* - cast assign cast int* - assign assign assign Note that all casts above are inherently unsafe and will only work if the type cast is indeed compatible. For example: int[4] a; int[4]* b = &a; int* c = b; // Safe cast: int[4]* d = (int[4]*)c; int e = 12; int* f = &e; // Incorrect, but not checked int[4]* g = (int[4]*)f; // Also incorrect but not checked. int[] h = f[0..2]; Internals Internally the layout of a slice is guaranteed to be struct { usize arraySize; <type>* ptrToArray; } . There is a built in struct __ArrayType_C3 which has the exact data layout of the fat array pointers. It is defined to be struct __ArrayType_C3 { usize arraySize; void* ptrToArray; } Iteration over arrays Slices, fixed and variable arrays may all be iterated over using foreach (Type x : array) : int[4] a = { 1, 2, 3, 5 }; foreach (int x : a) { ... } NOTE THAT THE SYNTAX WILL BE REVISED It is possible for any type to get this iteration by implementing the method macros _foreach _foreach_index : struct Vector { usize size; int* elements; } macro Vector._foreach_index(Vector* vector, $by_ref, $reverse; @body(index, value)) { usize size = vector.size; $IndexTyoe = $typeof(index); $if ($reverse): usize i = size; while (i-- >= 0) { $if ($by_ref): @body(($IndexType)i, &vector.elements[i])); $else: @body(($IndexType)i, vector.elements[i])); $endif; } $else: for (usize i = 0; i < size; i++) { $if ($by_ref): @body(($IndexType)i, &vector.elements[i])); $else: @body(($IndexType)i, vector.elements[i])); $endif; } $endif; } Vector v; v.add(3); v.add(7); // Will print 3 and 7 foreach (int i : v) { printf(\"%d\\n\"); }","title":"Arrays"},{"location":"arrays/#arrays","text":"Arrays has a central role in programming.

Removal of the old C macro system The old C macro system is replaced by a new C3 macro system. Import and modules C3 uses module imports instead of header includes to link modules together. Member access using . even for pointers The -> operator is removed, access uses dot for both direct and pointer access. Note that this is just single access: to access a pointer of a pointer (e.g. int** ) an explicit dereference would be needed. Different operator precedence Notably bit operations have higher precedence than +/-, making code like this: a & b == c evaluate like (a & b) == c instead of C's a & (b == c) . See the page about precedence rules . Removal of the const type qualifier The const qualifier is only retained for actual constant variables. C3 uses a special type of post condition for functions to indicate that they do not alter in parameters. /** * This function ensures that foo is not changed in the function, nor is bar.x altered. * @ensure const(foo), const(bar.x) **/ fn void test(Foo* foo, Bar* bar) { bar.y = foo.x; // bar.x = foo.x - compile time error! // foo.x = bar.y - compile time error! } Rationale: const correctness requires littering const across the code base. Although const is useful, it provides weaker guarantees that it appears. Fixed arrays do not decay and have copy sematics C3 has three different array types. Variable arrays and slices decay to pointers, but fixed arrays are value objects and do not decay. int[3] a = { 1, 2, 3 }; int[4]* b = &a; // No conversion int* c = a; // ERROR int* d = &a; // Valid implicit conversion int* e = b; // Valid implicit conversion int[3] f = a; // Copy by value! Removal of multiple declaration syntax Only a single declaration is allowed per statement in C3: int i, j; // ERROR int a; // Fine In conditionals, a special form of multiple declarations are allowed but each must then provide its type: for (int i = 0, int j = 1; i < 10; i++, j++) { ... } Integer promotions rules and safe signed-unsigned comparisons Promotion rules for integer types are different from C. Most prominently, C3 does left side widening in the case of long x = intValue1 + intValue2 . In C this becomes: long x = (long)(intValue1 + intValue2) , whereas in C3 it would behaves as long x = (long)intValue1 + (long)intValue2 to minimize chance of overflow. (read more on the conversion page . C3 also adds safe signed-unsigned comparisons : this means that comparing signed and unsigned values will always yield the correct result: // The code below will print \"Hello C3!\" on C3 and \"Hello C!\" in C. int i = -1; uint j = 1; // int z = i + j; <- Error, explicit cast needed. if (i < j) { printf(\"Hello C3!\\n\"); } else { printf(\"Hello C!\\n\"); } Goto removed goto is removed and replaced with labelled break and continue together with the nextcase statement that allows you to jump between cases in a switch statement. Rationale: It is very difficult to make goto work well with defer and implicit unwrapping of failables. It is not just making the compiler harder to write, but the code is harder to understand as well. The replacements together with defer cover many if not all usages of goto in regular code. Locals variables are implictly zeroed In C global variables are implicitly zeroed out, but local variables aren't. In C3 local variables are zeroed out by default, but may be explicitly undefined to get the C behaviour. Rationale: In the \"zero-is-initialization\" paradigm, zeroing variables, in particular structs, is very common. By offering zero initialization by default this avoids a whole class of vulnerabilites. Another alternative that was considered for C3 was mandatory initialization, but this adds a lot of extra boilerplate. C3 also offers a way to opt out of zero-initialization, so the change comes at no performance loss.

Here is an extremely brief (and not yet complete) overview. C As C3 is an evolution of C, the languages are quite similar. C3 adds features, but also removes a few. In C3 but not in C Module system Integrated build system Generics Semantic Macros Error handling Defer Value methods Associated enum data Distinct types and subtypes Optional contracts Built-in subarrays Foreach for iteration over arrays and types In C but not in C3 Qualified types ( const , volatile etc) Unsafe implicit conversions C++ C++ is a very complex object oriented \"almost superset\" of C. It tries to be everything to everyone, while squeezing this into a C syntax. The language is well known for its many pitfalls and quirky corners \u2013 as well as its long compile times. C3 is in many ways different from C++ in the same way that C is different from C++, but the semantic macro system and the generics close the gap in terms of writing reusable generic code. The module system and error handling is also very different from how C++ does things. In C++ but not in C3 Objects and classes RAII Exceptions In C3 but not in C++ Module system (yet) Integrated build system Semantic macros Error handling Defer Associated enum data Built-in subarrays Rust Rust is a safe systems programming language. While not quite as complex as C++, it is still a feature rich programming language with semantic macros, traits and pattern matching to mention a few. Error handling is handled using Result and Optional which is similar to how C3 works. C3 compares to Rust much like C, although the presence of built in subarrays and strings reduces the places where C3 is unsafe. Rust provides arrays and strings, but they are not built in. Subarrays are the same as Rust's slices. In Rust but not in C3 RAII Memory safety Safe union types with functions Different syntax from C Pattern matching Async built in In C3 but not in Rust Same ease of programming as C Optional contracts Familiar C syntax and behaviour Zig Zig is a systems programming language with extensive compile time execution to enable polymorphic functions and parameterized types. It aims to be a C replacement. Compared to C3, Zig tries to be a completely new language in terms of syntax and feel. C3 uses macros to a modest degree where it is more pervasive in Zig, and does not depart from C to the same degree. Like Rust, it features slices as a first class type. The standard library uses an explicit allocator to allow it to work with many different allocation strategies. Zig is a very ambitious project, aiming to support as many types of platforms as possible. In Zig but not in C3 Pervasive compile time execution. Memory allocation failure is an error. Toolchain uses build files written in native Zig. Different syntax and behaviour compared to C. Structs define namespace. Async primitives built in. Built in unit tests. Arbitrarily integer sizes. In C3 but not in Zig Module system. Integrated build system. C ABI compatibility by default. Optional contracts. Familiar C syntax and behaviour. Jai Jai is a programming language aimed at high performance game programming. It has an extensive compile time meta programming functionality, even to the point of being able to run programs at compile time. It also has compile time polymorphism, a powerful macro system and uses an implicit context system to switch allocation schemes. In Jai but not in C3 Pervasive compile time execution. Jai's compile time execution is the build system. Different syntax and behaviour compared to C. More powerful macro system than C3. Implicit constructors In C3 but not in Jai Module system Integrated build system Optional contracts Familiar C syntax and behaviour Fairly small language Odin Odin is a language built for high performance but tries to remain a simple language to learn. Superficially the syntax shares much with Jai, and some of Jai's features things \u2013 like an implicit context \u2013 also shows up in Odin. In contrast with both Jai and Zig, Odin uses only minimal compile time evaluation and instead only relies on parametric polymorphism to ensure reuse. It also contains conveniences, like maps and arrays built into the language. For error handling it relies on Go style tuple returns. In Odin but not in C3 Different syntax and behaviour compared to C Ad hoc parametric polymorphism Tuple returns A rich built in set of types In C3 but not in Odin Familiar C syntax and behaviour Semantic macros Value methods Optional contracts Error handling support D D is a huge language.

These are the rules for C3: float to int conversions require a cast int to float conversions do not require a cast bool to float converts to 0.0 / 1.0 widening float conversions are only conditionally allowed(*) narrowing conversions require a cast(*) widening int conversions are only conditionally allowed(*) signed <-> unsigned conversions of the same type do not require a cast. In conditionals float to bool do not require a cast, any non zero float value considered true Implicit conversion to bool only occurs in conditionals or when the value is enclosed in () e.g. bool x = (1.0) or if (1.0) { ... } C3 uses two's complement arithmetic for all integer math. Target type The left hand side of an assignment, or the parameter type in a call is known as the target type the target type is used for implicit widening and inferring struct initialization. Common arithmetic promotion Like C, C3 uses implicit arithmetic promotion of integer and floating point variables before arithmetic operations: For any floating point type with a bit width smaller than 32 bits, widen to float . E.g. f16 -> float For an integer type smaller than the minimum arithmetic width promote the value to a same signed integer of the minimum arithmetic width (this usually corresponds to a c int/uint). E.g. ushort -> uint Implicit narrowing An expression with an integer type, may implicitly narrow to smaller integer type, and similarly a float type may implicitly narrow to less wide floating point type is determined from the following algorithm. Look at the expression. If this expression's type is determined by its subexpression(s), recursively visit to find the leaves that determine the type of the expression. For each leaf, determine that the type before arithmetic promotion had a width equal or less than the type to convert to. In the case of an integer literal, instead of looking at the type, check that the integer would fit the type to narrow to. Basically, if all the sub expressions originally are small enough it's ok to implicitly convert the result. Examples f16 h = 12.0; float f = 13.0; double d = 22.0; char x = 1; short y = -3; int z = 0xFFFFF; ulong w = -0xFFFFFFF; x = x + x; // => calculated as x = (char)((int)x + (int)x); x = y + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed as y > char h = x * h; // => calculated as h = (f16)((float)x * (float)h); h = f + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed since f > f16 Implicit widening Unlike C, implicit widening will only happen on \"simple expressions\": if the expression is a primary expression, or a unary operation on a primary expression. For assignment, special rules hold. For an assignment to a binary expression, if its two subexpressions are \"simple expressions\" and the binary expression is + , - , / , * , allow an implicit promotion of the two sub expressions. int a = ... short b = ... char c = ... long d = ~a; // Valid - simple expression. int e = (int)(d + (a + b)); // Error int f = (int)(d + ~b); // Valid long g = a + b; // Valid long h = a + (b + c); // Error As a rule of thumb, if there are more than one possible conversion an explicit cast is needed. Example: long h = a + (b + c); // Possible intention 1 long h = (long)(a + (b + c)); // Possible intention 2 long h = (long)a + (long)(b + c); // Possible intention 3 long h = (long)a + ((long)b + (long)c); Maximum type The maximum type is a concept used when unifying two or more types. The algorithm follows: First perform implicit promotion. If both types are the same, the maximum type is this type. If one type is a floating point type, and the other is an integer type, the maximum type is the floating point type. E.g. int + float -> float . If both types are floating point types, the maximum type is the widest floating point type. E.g. float + double -> double . If both types are integer types with the same signedness, the maximum type is the widest integer type of the two. E.g. uint + ulong -> ulong . If both types are integer types with different signedness, the maximum type is a signed integer with the same bit width as the maximum integer type. ulong + int -> long If at least one side is a struct or a pointer to a struct with an inline directive on a member, check recursively check if the type of the inline member can be used to find a maximum type (see below under sub struct conversions) All other cases are errors. Substruct conversions Substructs may be used in place of its parent structs in many cases. The rule is as follows: A substruct pointer may implicitly convert to a parent struct. A substruct value may be implicitly assigned to a variable with the parent struct type, This will truncate the value, copying only the parent part of the substruct. However, a substruct value cannot be assigned its parent struct. Substruct subarrays, vararrays and arrays can not be cast (implicitly or explicitly) to an array of the parent struct type. Pointer conversions Pointer conversion between types usually need explicit casts. The exception is void * which any type may implicitly convert to or from . Conversion rules from and to arrays are detailed under arrays Binary conversions 1. Multiplication, division, remainder, subtraction / addition with both operands being numbers These operations are only valid for integer and float types. Resolve the operands. Find the maximum type of the two operands. Promote both operands to the resulting type if both are simple expressions The resulting type of the expression is the resulting type. 2. Addition with left side being a pointer Resolve the operands. If the rhs is not an integer, this is an error. If the rhs has a bit width that exceeds iptrdiff, this is an error. The result of the expression is the lhs type. 3. Subtraction with lhs pointer and rhs integer Resolve the operands. If the right hand type has a bit width that exceeds iptrdiff, this is an error. The result of the expression is the left hand type. 4. Subtraction with both sides pointers Resolve the operands. If the either side is a void * , it is cast to the other type. If the types of the sides are different, this is an error. The result of the expression is iptrdiff. If this result exceeds the target width, this is an error. 6. Bit operations ^ & | These operations are only valid for integers and booleans. Resolve the operands. Find the maximum type of the two operands. Promote both operands to the maximum type if they are simple expressions. The result of the expression is the maximum type. 6. Shift operations << >> These operations are only valid for integers. Resolve the operands. In safe mode, insert a trap to ensure that rhs >= 0 and rhs < bit width of the left hand side. 3The result of the expression is the lhs type. 7. Assignment operations += -= *= *= /= %= ^= |= &= Resolve the lhs. Resolve the right operand as an assignment rhs. The result of the expression is the lhs type. 8. Assignment shift >>= <<= Resolve both operands In safe mode, insert a trap to ensure that rhs >= 0 and rhs < bit width of the left hand side. The result of the expression is the lhs type. 9. && and || Resolve both operands. Insert bool cast of both operands. The type is bool. 10. <= == >= != Resolve the operands, left to right. Find the maximum type of the two operands. Promote both operands to the maximum type. The type is bool. Unary conversions 1. Bit negate Resolve the inner operand. If the inner type is not an integer this is an error. The type is the inner type. 2. Boolean not Resolve the inner operand. The type is bool. 3. Negation Resolve the inner operand. If the type inner type is not a number this is an error. If the inner type is an unsigned integer, cast it to the same signed type. The type is the type of the result from (3) 4. & and && Resolve the inner operand. The type is a pointer to the type of the inner operand. 5. * Resolve the inner operand. If the operand is not a pointer, or is a void * pointer, this is an error. The type is the pointee of the inner operand's type. Dereferencing 0 is implementation defined. 6. ++ and -- Resolve the inner operand. If the type is not a number, this is an error. The type is the same as the inner operand. Base expressions 1. Typed identifiers The type is that of the declaration. If the width of the type is less than that of the target type, widen to the target type. If the width of the type is greater than that of the target type, it is an error. 2. Constants and literals If the constant is an integer, it is assumed to be the arithmetic promotion width and signed. If the suffix u is added, it is assumed to be an unsigned number. If a suffix ixx or uxx is given then it is considered a an integer of that type width and signedness. It cannot be implicitly narrowed. If the constant is a floating point value, it is assumed to be a double unless suffixed with f which is then assumed to be a float .

C3 code: fn int! getValue(); Corresponding C code: Error getValue(int *value); The int! here is the failable return type, which is a tagged union: it might hold either the error or an int. Note: reflection methods on errors are not complete yet. // Open a file, we will get a failable: // Either a File* or an error.

Introduce a general static block. module foo; int x; static { x = rand(); } int y = rand(); fn int randomCalculation() { return rand(); } Sematic roughly work like in Java, except that all know globals are initialized before main, as opposed to when the class is invoked. The order of initialization is unspecified. Module versioning Follow Go Modules: Build file contains required library versions: e.g. 2.5.7 First number is major version number and is considered incompatible (basically a different module completely) Dependency resolution per major library version is done by picking the minimal version. E.g. module Foo requires Bar 1.5+ and module Baz requires 1.3+. Our module using Bar and Baz will resolve the minimal version to 1.3. This is the version that will be used. Note that if Foo used 2.5+, then both Bar 2.5 and 1.3 would be required. Limited operator overloading Use method macros to introduce some operator overloading and related functionality: macro Foo._foreach_index(Foo *f; index, value) { $IndexType = $typeof(index); usize len = f.len; for (usize i = 0; i < len; i++) { yield ($IndexType)(i), f.values[i]; } } macro Foo._initializer_list(Foo *f, $list) { $foreach ($i : $list): f.add($i); $endforeach; } The above would allow: Foo f = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" }; foreach(int i, value : f) { printf(\"%d: %s\\n\", i, f); } Which is transformed during macro expansion to: Foo f; f.add(\"a\"); f.add(\"b\"); f.add(\"c\"); usize len = f.len; for (usize i = 0; i < len; i++) { printf(\"%d: %s\\n\", (int)i, f.values[i]); } Generic as keyword for polymorphic functions For macros that essentially are polymorphic functions, we could use the keyword \"generic\" instead: macro swap(&a, &b) { ... } // Cannot be generic, captures are not allowed. macro max(a, b) { ... } // Can be generic macro doSomething(a, #a) { ... } // Cannot be generic, uses unevaluated expressions macro malloc($Type) { ... } // Can be generic. // Example of \"max\": generic max(a, b) { return a > b ? b : a; } // Example of \"malloc\" generic malloc($Type) { _builtin_malloc($sizeof($Type)); } Invocation changes: int max_value = @max(foo(), bar()); // macro int max_value = max(foo(), bar()); // generic This would furthermore remove the \"!\" addition for escaping macros, adding it as an attribute: macro returnme() @escaping { return; } Macros could then also more natural invoke defer: macro deferclose() @scopeless { defer close(); } Both would be invoked: @deferclose(); @returnme(); It would be possible to define a generic, such a generic could be taken the address of: #define intmax = max(int, int); #define TwoIntfn = fn int(int, int); TwoIntFunc x = &intmax; Associative array literals Syntax and implementation under consideration! Associative arrays are mappings between keys and values: IntStringMap x = { \"a\": 2, \"b\": { \"3\" : \"foo\" } }; To use an associative array, the struct needs to define the following generics: _map_init() and _map_init_add . In the example above, the actual code is compiled to: IntStringMap x; _map_init(&x); _map_init_add(&x, \"a\", 2); IntStringMap _temp; _map_init(&_temp); _map_init_add(&x, \"3\", \"foo\"); _map_init_add(&x, \"b\", _temp); Array literals Arrays can be initialized using compound literals, but there is also a special format for array initialization using [] . In this case, the type is inferred. It allows uniform initialization of all types of arrays: int[3] y = [1, 2, 3]; // Fixed array allocated on the stack int[] z = [1, 2, 3]; // Slice pointing at literal allocated on the stack It offers some convenience when calling functions taking arrays: fn void test1(int[3] x) { ... } fn void test2(int[] y) { ... } fn void test2(int[3]* z) { ... } test1([ 1, 2, 3 ]); test2([ 1, 2, 3 ]); test3([ 1, 2, 3 ]); Allow slicing of user defined containers // Supporting the full set. macro Foo._slice(Foo* foo, a, b, $a_from_end, $b_from_end) { $if ($a_from_end): $if ($b_from_end): return foo.values[^a..^b]; $endif: return foo.values[^a..b]; $endif; $if ($b_from_end): return foo.values[a..^b]; $endif; return foo.values[a..b]; } // Not supporting reverse macro Bar._slice(Bar *bar, a, b, $a_from_end, $b_from_end) { $assert(!$a_from_end && !$b_from_end, \"Slicing from the end is not possible for Bar types.\"); return bar.valyes[a..b]; } Allow narrowing conversions for floats Narrowing conversions for double -> float are common and might not be sufficiently important to do explicitly. Tests built in Unit tests built in as an integral part of the language like D. Attribute to ensure alignment @assertalign works as GCCs warn_if_not_aligned. On non packed structs, this will prevent compilation if padding is inserted in front of the member. On a packed struct, it will prevent compilation if it is not aligned. Binary include The ability to include a binary file during compile time. An additional embed-path gives search dirs. byte[] file = @binary_include(\"foo.dat\"); Limiting embed to x bytes: byte[] file = @binary_include(\"/dev/urandomg\", 16); Compile time run-include The ability to run a piece of code at compile time and include the result in the code. @run_include(\"foo.sh\", $some_param, \"-x\", $another_param); Macro text interpolation For certain cases, pure text interpolation might be needed. Within macros, any text within `` can be evaluated and parsed. macro void @foo($x, #f) { `#f $x * $x`; } fn void test() { int x = 1; @foo(4, \"x +=\"); // Expands to -> // x += 4 * 4; } Another example, showing the difference between #var and `#var` : macro void @foo2(#f) { printf(\"%s was %d\\n\", #f, `#f`); } funct void test2() { int x = 1; @foo2(x); // Expands to -> // printf(\"%s was %d\\n\", \"x\", x); } Compile time string functions In order to facilitate certain types of macros, the following macros are built in: @strToUpper(#f) Convert string to upper case. @strToLower(#f) Convert string to lower case. @strToVarName(#f, #space) Convert string to camel case from a space-based name scheme. @strToTypeName(#f, #space) Convert string to title case from a space-based name scheme. @strFromName(#f, #space) Convert title case or lower camel case to a space based scheme. @strReplace(#str, #pattern, #replacement, #count) Replace a string with another. @subString(#str, #start, #length) Return a substring of a compile time string. @strFind(#str, #stringToFind) Find a substring in a compile time string. @strHash(#str) Return the FNV1a hash of a string. @strLen(#str) Return a compile time length of a string. @stringify(#str) Escapes a string so it becomes a valid string.

Question about memory management is the same. int[int] map; // Built-in maps map[1] = 11; // Retrieving a value int i = map[0]!!; // Requires a rethrow // Retrive or use default int i = try map[12] else -1; // Extend a map: fn bool int[int].remove_if_negative(int[int] *map, int index) { if (try map[index] >= 0 else true) return false; map.remove(index); return true; } // The underlying C function becomes: // bool module_name__map_int_int__remove_if_negative(struct _map_int_int *map, int32_t index); Built in string type Strings are built-in, refcounted(?) null-terminated character arrays. Take a long hard look at memory management (here too) string = \"Hello\"; string += \" World\"; char* data = &string; // Taking a pointer to the string, which may later be invalid. Built in managed pointers Taking a hint from Cyclone, Rust etc one could consider managed pointers / objects. There are several possibilities: Introduce something akin to move/borrow syntax with a special pointer type, eg. Foo@ x vs Foo* y and make the code track Foo@ to have unique ownership. Introduce ref-counted objects with ref-counted pointers. Again use Foo@ x vs Foo* y with the latter being unretained. This should be internal refcounting to avoid any of the issues going from retained -> unretained that shared_ptr has. Consequently any struct that is RC:ed needs to be explicitly declared as such. Managed pointers: you alloc and the pointer gets a unique address that will always be invalid after use. Any overflows will be detected, but use of managed pointers is slower due to redirect and check. Ideas around macros Just some previous thoughts and ideas I've considered. Many of those actually go against the current design. Compile time variables This is a variant of what already exists in C, but in a syntactically more friendly way. For example this would be ok: macro swap(a, b) { $x = $typeof(a); static_assert($typeof(b) == $x); $x temp = a; a = b; b = a; } The example above is a bit contrived as in the above example we could simply have: macro swap(a, b) { $static_assert($typeof(b) == $typeof(b)); $typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = a; } But still, it serves as an example on how to use it. Capturing trailing compound statement public macro foreach(thelist, @body(Element *) ) { Element* iname = thelist.first; while (iname != nil) { @body(iname); iname = iname.next; } } Or a version that is more flexible: public macro foreach(thelist, @body(typeof(thelist.first)) ) { $typeof(thelist.first) iname = thelist.first; while (iname != nil) { @body(iname); iname = iname.next; } } // Usage: foreach(list, Element *i) // <- Note type declaration! { i.print(); } Since type is going to appear very often, we could make a shortcut for it, like $@ as prefix meaning \"typeof\". We then get public macro foreach(thelist, @body($@thelist.first)) { $@thelist.first iname = thelist.first; while (iname != nil) { @body(iname); iname = iname.next; } } Possibly one could even write the code like this: public macro foreach(thelist, @body($element_type) ) { $element_type iname = thelist.first; while (iname != nil) { @body(iname); iname = iname.next; } } In this case $element_type works like \"auto\", but is also assigned the type, which then can be referred to in the signature. Stepwise from C macros into C3 macros #define ADD_TO(x, y) { x += y; } ADD_TO(x, 1) The { } introduces a multiline macro that does not need explicit linebreaks. Now, add the \"$\" symbol to introduce hygienic temporaries: #define SWAP(x, y) { typeof(x) $tmp = x; x = y; y = $tmp; } Here $tmp will actually be replaced by __<macro>_<variable_name>_<instance> when translating to C, so __SWAP_tmp_1 , __SWAP_tmp_2 etc. We then introduce the syntax macros using: macro swap(&a, &b) { typeof(a) $tmp = a; b = a; a = $tmp; } (Note the different use of $ here as compared to previous macro ideas where $ is a compile time evaluated variable!) The use of &a follows C++ standard: it simply refers to a variable OR EXPRESSION that is imported into its scope. Using the unadorned variable name as evaluated expression allows us to write this code: macro max(a, b) { return (a > b ? a : b) } The above code is equivalent to: macro max(&a, &b) { typeof(a) $tmp_a = a; typeof(b) $tmp_b = b; $tmp_a > $tmp_b ? $tmp_a : $tmp_b } Or in (GNU) C: #define max(a,b) \\ ({ __typeof__ (a) _a = (a); \\ __typeof__ (b) _b = (b); \\ _a > _b ? _a : _b; }) To recap: Add the { } format to #define for multiline defines. Add $<name> format as hygienic variable names. Add the syntax \"macro\" type of definition. The syntax macro makes a difference between \"normal\" parameters (with & as prefix) and \"evaluated\" parameters (unadorned variables) Important is also to scope the macros: #define is always defined local to a scope (unlike in C). This means that #define FOO printf(\"foo\"); { #define BAR printf(\"bar\"); } FOO // adds printf(\"foo\"); BAR; // Error, define not available in scope; This also means that a define can be declared public to be accessed as if defined from the top of the file scope: // file 1 module foo public #define FOO { printf(\"FOO!\\n\"); } // file 2 import foo fn void test() { foo.FOO } Only defines in the file scope that exists in the file scope may be public and used in other modules. Yet another macro proposal I found Simple macros macro @foo(&b) { b++; } fn test() { int x = 1; @foo(x); } // Same as: fn void test() { int x = 1; x++; } Macro with compile time values: macro @foo($x, &b) { b += $x; } fn void test() { int x = 1; @foo(10, x); } // Expands to: fn void test() { int x = 1; x += 10; } Macro with string capture macro @foo($x, #f) { `#f $x * $x`; } fn void test() { int x = 1; @foo(4, \"x += \"); } // Expands to fn void test() { int x = 1; x += 4 * 4; } macro @foo2(#f) { printf(\"%s was %d\\n\", #f, `#f`); } funct void test2() { i32 x = 1; @foo2(\"x\"); } // Expands to funct void test2() { i32 x = 1; printf(\"%s was %d\\n\", \"x\", x); } Macro with conditional compile time values macro @foo($x, &b) { $IF ($x > 3) { b += $x * $x; } $ELSE { b += $x; } } fn void test() { i32 x = 1; @foo(10, x); @foo(2, x); } // Expands to fn void test() { i32 x = 1; x += 100; x += 2; } Nested macros (don't do this, but an example) macro @foo($a) { printf(\"%d\\n\", $a); $IF($a > 0) { @foo($a - 1); } } fn void test() { @foo(2); } // Expands to fn void test() { printf(\"%d\\n\", 2); printf(\"%d\\n\", 1); printf(\"%d\\n\", 0); } The above suggests macro sugar of loops: macro @foo($a) { $EACH(0..$a AS $x) { printf(\"%d\\n\", $x); } } macro @foo_enum(&a) { $EACH(a AS $x) { printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)($x)); } } enum MyEnum { A, B, FOO } fn void test() { @foo_enum(MyEnum); } // Expands to fn void test() { printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)(A)); printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)(B)); printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)(FOO)); } Each may iterate over: struct members (returned as string), enums (returned as the enum value) Type group helper macro @foo(int& a) // Macro only valid for a is any type of signed integer macro @foo(integer& a) // Valid for unsigned and signed integers macro @foo(number& a) // Valid for any float or integer Macros may force non local return macro @foo() { exit 1; // other keyword? 'escape'? I think exit is good, // but clashes with function name! } fn int test() { @foo(); } // expands to fn int test() { return 1; } Normal return creates a statement expression macro @foo(&a) { int x = a; x++; if (x > 0) return 1; return 2; } fn int test() { b = 10; int y = @foo(b); } // Expands to: fn int test() { b = 10; int __macro_ret_1; do { int __macro_x = b; __macro_x++; if (__macro_x > 0) { __macro_ret_1 = 1; break; } else { __macro_ret_1 = 2; break; } } while (0); int y = __macro_ret_1; } Bodies in macros macro @foo(&a, @body) { int z = 0; while (a < 10) { @body(); z++; } } fn void test() { int i = 0; @foo(i) { i += 1; } } // Expands to fn void test() { int i = 0; { int __macro_z = 0; while (i < 10) { i += 1; __macro_z++; } } } Bodies in macros with parameters macro @foo(&a, @body(&x, $y)) { int z = 0; while (a < 10) { @body(z, 2); z++; } } fn void test() { int i = 0; @foo(i) { printf(\"%d / %d\\n\", x, y); } } // Expands to fn void test() { int i = 0; { int __macro_z = 0; while (i < 10) { printf(\"%d / %d\\n\", __macro_z, 2); __macro_z++; } } } Expression is extended to parse: MACRO_IDENT => lookup $x in current macro scope and replace it with literal. Error if not in macro. MACRO_REPLACEMENT => invoke lexer on code inside, after doing a replace of any # inside. $IF requires that the expression can be evaluated to a constant value, similar holds for the range in $EACH . The general rule: 1. An argument prefixed with $ is always something that must be constant. 2. An argument prefixed with & is always a reference to an outer variable. 3. An argument prefixed with # always matches a string. It will be expanded when lexed in `` statements 4. A $ variable can be converted to a # variable. 5. A # can be evaluated to a $ 6. $ and # cannot be assigned to, they are always constant. 7. $ , & and # will never shadow variables from the outer scope.","title":"Crazy ideas"},{"location":"ideas/#ideas","text":"WARNING Unfinished ideas / brain dumps","title":"Ideas"},{"location":"ideas/#static-initializers","text":"Allow initialization of globals before main is invoked.

Stringingification #define DECLARE_STRING(name, s) char *name##_str = #s; // C3 ... currently no corresponding functionality ... Top level evaluation Script languages, and also upcoming languages like Jai , usually have unbounded top level evaluation. The flexibility of this style of meta programming has a trade off in making the code more challenging to understand. In C3, top level compile time evaluation is limited to $if and $switch constructs + macros with constant expression evaluation. This makes the code easier to read, but at the cost of expressive power. Macro declarations A macro is defined using macro <name>(<parameters>) . All user defined macros use the @ symbol. The parameters have different sigils: $ means compile time evaluated (constant expression or type). # indicates an expression that is not yet evaluated, but is bound to where it was defined. Finally & is used to implicitly pass a parameter by reference. A basic swap: /** * @checked a = b, b = a */ macro void swap(&a, &b) { $typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; } This expands on usage like this: fn void test() { int a = 10; int b = 20; @swap(a, b); } // Equivalent to: fn void test() { int a = 10; int b = 20; { int __temp = a; a = b; b = __temp; } } Note the necessary & . Here is an incorrect swap and what it would expand to: macro void badswap(a, b) { $typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; } fn void test() { int a = 10; int b = 20; @badswap(a, b); } // Equivalent to: fn void test() { int a = 10; int b = 20; { int __a = a; int __b = b; int __temp = __a; __a = __b; __b = __temp; } } Macro methods Similar to regular methods a macro may also be associated with a particular type: struct Foo { ... } macro Foo.generate(Foo *foo) { ... } Foo f; f.@generate(); Capturing a trailing block It is often useful for a macro to take a trailing compound statement as an argument. In C++ this pattern is usually expressed with a lambda, but in C3 this is completely inlined. To accept a trailing block, ; @name(param1, ...) is placed after declaring the regular macro parameters. Here's an example to illustrate its use: /** * A macro looping through a list of values, executing the body once * every pass. * * @checked { int i = a.len; value2 = a[i]; } **/ macro foreach(a; @body(index, value)) { for (int i = 0; i < a.len; i++) { @body(i, a[i]); } } fn void test() { double[] a = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 }; @foreach(a; int index, double value) { io::printf(\"a[%d] = %f\\n\", index, value); } } // Expands to code similar to: fn void test() { int[] a = { 1, 2, 3 }; { int[] __a = a; for (int __i = 0; i < __a.len; i++) { io::printf(\"Value: %d, x2: %d\\n\", __value1, __value2); } } } Macros returning values A macro may return a value, it is then considered an expression rather than a statement: macro square(x) { return x * x; } int getTheSquare(int x) { return @square(x); } double getTheSquare2(double x) { return @square(x); } Calling macros It's perfectly fine for a macro to invoke another macro or itself. macro square(x) { return x * x; } macro squarePlusOne(x) { return @square(x) + 1; // Expands to \"return x * x + 1;\" } The maximum recursion depth is limited to the macro-recursion-depth build setting. Macro directives Inside of a macro, we can use the compile time statements $if , $for and $switch . Macros may also be recursively invoked. As previously mentioned, $if and $switch may also be invoked on the top level. $if, $else and $elif $if (<const expr>): takes a compile time constant value and evaluates it to true or false. macro foo($x, $y) { $if ($x > 3): $y += $x * $x; $else: $y += $x; $endif; } const int FOO = 10; fn void test() { int a = 5; int b = 4; @foo(1, a); // Allowed, expands to a += 1; // @foo(b, a); // Error: b is not a compile time constant. @foo(FOO, a); // Allowed, expands to a += FOO * FOO; } Loops using $foreach and $for $foreach (<range> : <variable>): ... $endforeach; allows compile time recursion. $foreach may recurse over enums, struct fields or constant ranges. Everything must be known at compile time. Compile time looping: macro foo($a) { $for (var $x = 0; $x < $a; $x++): io::printf(\"%d\\n\", $x); $endfor; } fn void test() { @foo(2); // Expands to -> // io::printf(\"%d\\n\", 0); // io::printf(\"%d\\n\", 1); } Looping over enums: macro foo_enum($SomeEnum) { $foreach ($x : $SomeEnum.elements): io::printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)$x); $endforeach; } enum MyEnum { A, B, } fn void test() { @foo_enum(MyEnum); // Expands to -> // io::printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)MyEnum.A); // io::printf(\"%d\\n\", (int)MyEnum.B); } An important thing to note is that the content of the $foreeach or $for body must be a complete statement. It's not possible to compile partial statements. Switching on type with $switch It's possible to switch on type: macro void foo(a, b) { $switch(a, b): $case int, int: return a * b; $endswitch; return a + b; } Escape macros Usually macro will generate its own scope, so that break, return, continue and next only stays valid inside of the macro's \"scope\". A return from inside a macro does not normally escape the scope into which it's called: macro void @foo() { return; } fn void test() { @foo(); // Doesn't do anything. io::printf(\"Test\"); } However, sometimes macros are needed that does not create its own scope, allowing return, break etc work as if it was part of the included scope. Escape macros does exactly that. Adding the attribute @escape removes capturing return. macro void @foo() @escape { return; } fn void test() { @foo(); // The function returns here. io::printf(\"Test\"); // Never printed! } This is not limited to return: break , continue and next is allowed. macro next($f) @escape { nextcase $f; } fn void test() { int i = 1; switch (i) { case 1: @next(3); io::println(\"Foo\"); case 3: io::println(\"Bar!\") } } The above code will print \"Bar!\" Conditional macros at the top level A limitation with the macros is that they are only used within functions. This is deliberate \u2013 macros expanding at the top level are much harder to reason about since they should be able to define new types or change the meaning of the code that follows. Still, the usefulness of top level macros is great, which is why C3 offers three pieces of functionality for the top level: conditional compilation, global constants and attributes Conditional compilation Conditional compilation is done with $if and $else , which works just like inside of functions. $if ($defined(platform::OS) && platform::OS == WIN32): fn void doSomethingWin32Specific() { /* .... */ } $endif; Global constants Global constant on the top level work like compile time variables in macros \u2013 with the exception that they must always be declared constant. They are always evaluated in order, which has to be taken into account when used in conjunction with @defined.

When doing builds, any C3 file must start with the module keyword, specifying the module. When compiling single files, the module is not needed and the module name is assumed to be the file name, converted to lower case, with any invalid characters replaced by underscore ( _ ). A module can consist of multiple files, e.g. file_a.c3 module foo; /* ... */ file_b.c3 module foo; /* ... */ file_c.c3 module bar; /* ... */ Here file_a.c3 and file_b.c3 belong to the same module, foo while file_c.c3 belongs to to bar . Details Some details about the C3 module system: Modules can be arbitrarily nested, e.g. module foo::bar::baz; to create the sub module baz in the sub module bar of the module foo . Module names must be alphanumeric lower case letters plus the underscore character: _ . Module names are limited to 31 characters. Importing modules Importing a module uses the import keyword. Imports have file scope, so consequently if file_a.c3 imports the module networking , then file_b.c3 cannot use those symbols unless it also imports networking . file_a.c3 module foo; //import bar and stdio import bar; import stdio; /* ... */ file_b.c3 module foo; //import bar and networking imported, but not stdio import bar; import networking; /* ... */ Visibility All files in the same module share the same global declaration namespace. By default a symbol is visible to anyone importing a module. To make a symbol only visible inside the module, use the keyword private . module foo; fn void init() { .. } private fn void open() { .. } In this example, the other modules can use the init() function after importing foo, but only files in the foo module can use open(), as it is specified as private . Overriding symbol visibility rules By using private after import , it's possible to access another module\u00b4s private symbols. Many other module systems have hierarchal visibility rules, but the import private feature allows visibility to be manipulated in a more ad-hoc manner without imposing hard rules. For example, you may provide a library with two modules: \"mylib::net\" and \"mylib::file\" - which both use functions and types from a common \"mylib::internals\" module. The two libraries use import private mylib::internals to access this module's private functions and type. To an external user of the library, the \"mylib::internals\" does not seem to exist, but inside of your library you use it as a shared dependency. A simple example: // File a.c3 module a; private fn void aFunction() { ... } // File b.c3 module b; private fn void bFunction() { ... } // File c.c3 module c; import a; import private b; fn void test() { a::aFunction(); // <-- error, aFunction is private b::bFunction(); // Allowed since import was \"private\" } Private modules Modules may be declared using private , this makes the whole module private. Such a module must always be imported using import private . module private foo; ... module bar; import private foo; // Allowed ... module baz; import foo; // Error, trying to import private module. Using functions and types from other modules As a rule, functions, macros, constants, variables and types in the same module do not need any namespace prefix. For imported modules the following rules hold: Functions, macros, constants and variables require at least the (sub-) module name. Types do not require the module name unless the name is ambiguous. In case of ambiguity, only so many levels of module names are needed as to make the symbol unambiguous. // File a.c3 module a; struct Foo { ... } struct Bar { ... } struct TheAStruct { ... } fn void anAFunction() { ... } // File b.c3 module b; struct Foo { ... } struct Bar { ... } struct TheBStruct { ... } fn void aBFunction() { ... } // File c.c3 module c; import a; import b; struct TheCStruct { ... } struct Bar { ... } fn void aCFunction() { ... } fn void test() { TheAStruct stA; TheBStruct stB; TheCStruct stC; // Name required to avoid ambiguity; b::Foo stBFoo; // Will always pick the current module's // name. Bar bar; // Namespace required: a::aAFunction(); b::aBFunction(); // A local symbol does not require it: aCFunction(); } This means that the rule for the common case can be summarized as Types are used without prefix; functions, variables, macros and constants are prefixed with the sub module name. Textual includes It's sometimes useful to include an entire file, doing so employs the $include function. NOTE: This feature may significantly change.

It is intended to help you take a piece of C code and understand how it can be converted manually to C3. Struct, enum and union declarations Don't add a ; after enum, struct and union declarations, and note the slightly different syntax for declaring a named struct inside of a struct. // C typedf struct { int a; struct { double x; } bar; } Foo; // C3 struct Foo { int a; struct bar { double x; } } Also, user defined types are used without a struct , union or enum keyword, as if the name was a C typedef. Arrays Array sizes are written next to the type and arrays do not decay to pointers, you need to do it manually: // C int x[2] = { 1, 2 }; int *y = x; // C3 int[2] x = { 1, 2 }; int *y = &x; You will probably prefer slices to pointers when passing data around: // C int x[100] = ...; int y[30] = ...; int z[15] = ...; sortMyArray(x, 100); sortMyArray(y, 30); // Sort part of the array! sortMyArray(z + 1, 10); // C3 int[100] x = ...; int[30] y = ...; sortMyArray(&x); // Implicit conversion from int[100]* -> int[] sortMyArray(&y); // Implicit conversion from int[30]* -> int[] sortMyArray(z[1..10]; // Inclusive ranges! Note that declaring an array of inferred size will look different in C3: // C int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 }; // x is int[3] // C3 int[*] x = { 1, 2, 3 }; // x is int[3] Arrays are trivially copyable: // C int x[3] = ...; int y[3]; for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) y[i] = x[i]; // C3 int[3] x = ...; int[3] y = x; See more here . Undefined behaviour C3 has less undefined behaviour, in particular integers are defined as using 2s complement and signed overflow is wrapping. See more here . Functions Functions are declared like C, but you need to put fn in front: // C: int foo(Foo *b, int x, void *z) { ... } // C3 fn int foo(Foo* b, int x, void *z) { ... } See more about functions, like named and default arguments here . Calling C functions Declare a function (or variable) with extern and it will be possible to access it from C3: // To access puts: extern fn int puts(char*); ... puts(\"Hello world\"); Note that currently only the C standard library is automatically passed to the linker. In order to link with other libraries, you either need to explicitly tell the compiler to link them. If you want to use a different identifier inside of your C3 code compared to the function or variable's external name \u2013 use the @extname attribute: extern fn int _puts(char* message) @extname(\"puts\"); ... _puts(\"Hello world\"); // <- calls the puts function in libc Identifiers Name standards are enforced: // Starting with uppercase and followed somewhere by at least // one lower case is a user defined type: Foo x; M____y y; // Starting with lowercase is a variable or a function or a member name: x.myval = 1; int z = 123; fn void fooBar(int x) { ... } // Only upper case is a constant or an enum value: const int FOOBAR = 123; enum Test { STATE_A = 0, STATE_B = 2 } Variable declaration Declaring more than one variable at a time is not allowed: // C int a, b; // Not allowed in C3 // C3 int a; int b; In C3, variables are always zero initialized, unless you explicitly opt out using void : // C int a = 0; int b; // C3 int a; int b = void; Casts You can cast one struct to another as long as they are structurally equivalent: struct Foo { int a; int b; } struct Bar { int x; int y; } Foo f = { 1, 2 }; Bar b = (Bar)f; Compound literals Compound literals look different, but assigning to a struct will infer the type even if it's not the initializer. // C Foo f = { 1, 2 }; f = (Foo) { 1, 2 }; callFoo((Foo) { 2, 3 }); // C3 Foo f = { 1, 2 }; f = { 1, 2 }; callFoo(Foo({ 2, 3 })); Typedef Instead of typedef , use define // C typedef Foo* FooPtr; // C3 define FooPtr = Foo*; define also allows you to do things that otherwise you'd use #define for: // C #define puts println #define my_string my_excellent_string char *my_string = \"Party on\"; ... println(my_excellent_string); // C3 define println = puts; define my_excellent_string = my_string; char* my_string = \"Party on\"; ... println(my_excellent_string); Read more about define here . Basic types Several C types that would be variable sized are fixed size, and others changed names: // C int16_t a; int32_t b; int64_t c; uint64_t d; size_t e; ssize_t f; ptrdiff_t g; intptr_t h; // C3 short a; // Guaranteed 16 bits int b; // Guaranteed 32 bits long c; // Guaranteed 64 bits ulong d; // Guaranteed 64 bits usize e; // Same as C size_t, depends on target isize f; // Same width as usize but signed iptrdiff g; // Same as C ptrdiff_t depends on target iptr h; // Same as intptr_t depends on target ireg i; // Register sized integer Read more about types here . Instead of #include: Modules and import Modules are not mandatory but create a namespace, to import the names from a module, use import : module mylib::foo; fn void test() { ... } struct FooStruct { ... } module mylib::bar; import mylib::foo; fn void myCheck() { foo::test(); // foo prefix is mandatory. mylib::foo::test(); // This also works; FooStruct x; // But user defined types don't need the prefix. mylib::foo::FooStruct y; // But it is allowed. } Comments The /* */ comments are nesting: /* This /* will all */ be commented out */ Note that doc comments, starting with /** has special rules for parsing it, and is not considered a regular comment. See preconditions for more information. Type qualifiers Qualifiers like const and volatile are removed, but const before a constant will make it treated as a compile time constant. The constant does not need to be typed. const A = false; // Compile time $if (A): // This will not be compiled $else: // This will be compiled $endif volatile is replaced by macros for volatile load and store. Goto removed goto is removed, but there is labelled break and continue as well as defer to handle the cases when it is commonly used in C. // C Foo *foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo)); if (tryFoo(foo)) goto FAIL; if (modifyFoo(foo)) goto FAIL; free(foo); return true; FAIL: free(foo); return false; // C3 Foo *foo = @mem::malloc(Foo); defer free(foo); if (tryFoo(foo)) return false; if (modifyFoo(foo)) return false; return true; Changes in switch case statements automatically break. Use nextcase to fallthrough to the next statement, but empty case statements have implicit fallthrough: // C switch (a) { case 1: case 2: doOne(); break; case 3: i = 0; case 4: doFour(); break; case 5: doFive(); default: return false; } // C3 switch (a) { case 1: case 2: doOne(); case 3: i = 0; nextcase; case 4: doFour(); case 5: doFive(); nextcase; default: return false; } Note that we can jump to an arbitrary case using C3: // C switch (a) { case 1: doOne(); goto LABEL3; case 2: doTwo(); break; case 3: LABEL3: doThree(); default: return false; } // C3 switch (a) { case 1: doOne(); nextcase 3; case 2: doTwo(); case 3: doThree(); nextcase; default: return false; } Other changes The following things are enhancements to C, that does not have a direct counterpart in C.

Constructors and destructors A fundamental concept in C3 is that data is not \"active\". This is to say there is no code associated with the data implicitly unlike constructors and destructors in an object oriented language. Not having constructors / destructors prevents RAII-style resource handling, but also allows the code to assume the memory can be freely allocated and initialized as it sees fit, without causing any corruption or undefined behaviour.

Non-terminals are in lower case. Lexical tokens are enclosed in single quotes ''. The form a..b represents the set of characters from a through b as alternatives. Source code representation A program consists of one or more translation units stored in files written in the Unicode character set, stored as a sequence of bytes using the UTF-8 encoding. Except for comments and the contents of character and string literals, all input elements are formed only from the ASCII subset (U+0000 to U+007F) of Unicode. A raw byte stream is translated into a sequence of tokens which white space and non-doc comments are discarded. Doc comments may optionally be discarded as well. The resulting input elements form the tokens that are the terminal symbols of the syntactic grammar. Lexical Translations A raw byte stream is translated into a sequence of tokens which white space and non-doc comments are discarded. Doc comments may optionally be discarded as well. The resulting input elements form the tokens that are the terminal symbols of the syntactic grammar. The longest possible translation is used at each step, even if the result does not ultimately make a correct program while another lexical translation would. Example: a--b is translated as a , -- , b , which does not form a grammatically correct expression, even >though the tokenization a , - , - , b could form a grammatically correct expression. Line Terminators The C3 compiler divides the sequence of input bytes into lines by recognizing line terminators Lines are terminated by the ASCII LF character (U+000A), also known as \"newline\". A line termination specifies the termination of the // form of a comment. Input Elements and Tokens An input element may be: White space Comment Doc Comment Token A token may be: Identifier Keyword Literal Separator Operator A Doc Comment consists of: A stream of descriptive text A list of directive Tokens Those input elements that are not white space or comments are tokens. The tokens are the terminal symbols of the syntactic grammar. Whitespace and comments can serve to separate tokens that might be tokenized in another manner. For example the characters + and = may form the operator token += only if there is no intervening white space or comment. White Space White space is defined as the ASCII horizontal tab character (U+0009), form feed character (U+000A), vertical tab (U+000B), carriage return (U+000D), space character (U+0020) and the line terminator character (U+000D).

The text between /// and line end is optionally parsed using the doc comment syntactic grammar. A compiler may choose to read /// as a regular comment. Identifiers Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter or underscore. C3 has three types of identifiers: const identifiers - containing only underscore and upper-case letters, type identifiers - starting with an upper case letter followed by at least one underscore letter and regular identifiers, starting with a lower case letter.

An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: 0b or 0B for binary, 0o, or 0O for octal, and 0x or 0X for hexadecimal. A single 0 is considered a decimal zero. In hexadecimal literals, letters a through f and A through F represent values 10 through 15. For readability, an underscore character _ may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal's value.

A decimal floating-point literal consists of an integer part (decimal digits), a decimal point, a fractional part (decimal digits), and an exponent part (e or E followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; one of the decimal point or the exponent part may be elided. An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by powers of 10. A hexadecimal floating-point literal consists of a 0x or 0X prefix, an integer part (hexadecimal digits), a radix point, a fractional part (hexadecimal digits), and an exponent part (p or P followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; the radix point may be elided as well, but the exponent part is required. An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by powers of 2. For readability, an underscore character _ may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal value.

Escape sequences can be used to represent byte values 0-31 and 128-255. The following backslash escapes are available to escape: \\0 0x00 zero value \\a 0x07 alert/bell \\b 0x08 backspace \\e 0x1B escape \\f 0x0C form feed \\n 0x0A newline \\r 0x0D carriage return \\t 0x09 horizontal tab \\v 0x0B vertical tab \\\\ 0x5C backslash \\' 0x27 single quote ' \\\" 0x22 double quote \" \\x Escapes a single byte hex value \\u Escapes a two byte unicode hex value \\U Escapes a four byte unicode hex value CHAR_ELEMENT ::= [\\x20-\\x26] | [\\x28-\\x5B] | [\\x5D-\\x7F] CHAR_LIT_BYTE ::= CHAR_ELEMENT | \\x5C CHAR_ESCAPE CHAR_ESCAPE ::= [abefnrtv\\'\\\"\\\\] | 'x' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT UNICODE_CHAR ::= unicode_char | 'u' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT | 'U' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT CHARACTER_LIT ::= \"'\" (CHAR_LIT_BYTE+) | UNICODE_CHAR \"'\" String literals A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters. String literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in \"bar\". Within the quotes, any character may appear except newline and unescaped double quote. The text between the quotes forms the value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted as they are in rune literals, with the same restrictions. The two-digit hexadecimal (\\xnn) escapes represent individual bytes of the resulting string; all other escapes represent the (possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 encoding of individual characters. Thus inside a string literal \\xFF represent a single byte of value 0xFF=255, while \u00ff, \\u00FF, \\U000000FF and \\xc3\\xbf represent the two bytes 0xc3 0xbf of the UTF-8 encoding of character U+00FF. STRING_LIT ::= \\x22 (CHAR_LIT_BYTE | UNICODE_CHAR)* \\x22 Types Types consist of built-in types and user-defined types (enums, structs, unions, bitstructs, errtype and distinct). Boolean types The Integer types Floating point types Vector types Complex types A complex type is defined as a struct with two elements of the same floating point type. The first member holds the real part of a complex number, and the second member holds the imaginary part. struct Complex { float real; float imaginary; } String types Array types An array has the alignment of its element. Zero sized arrays are allowed and have the size 0. Vararray types Subarray types The subarray consist of a pointer, followed by a usize length, having the alignment of pointers. Pointer types Struct types A struct without any members or with only arrays of size 0 have the size 0. The alignment of a struct without any members is 1. Union types The alignment of a union without any members is 1. Error types Th Enum types Function types Virtual types Declarations and scope Expressions Casts Pointer casts Integer to pointer cast Any integer of pointer size or larger may be explicitly cast to a pointer. An integer to pointer cast is considered non-constant, except in the special case where the integer == 0. In that case, the result is constant null . Example: byte a = 1; int* b = (int*)a; // Invalid, pointer type is > 8 bits. int* c = (int*)1; // Valid, but runtime value. int* d = (int*)0; // Valid and constant value. Pointer to integer cast A pointer may be cast to any integer, truncating the pointer value if the size of the pointer is larger than the pointer size. A pointer to integer cast is considered non-constant, except in the special case of a null pointer, where it is equal to the integer value 0. Example: fn void test() { ... } define VoidFunc = fn void test(); VoidFunc a = &test; int b = (int)null; int c = (int)a; // Invalid, not constant int d = (int)((int*)1); // Invalid, not constant Subscript operator The subscript operator may take as its left side a pointer, array, subarray or vararray. The index may be of any integer type. TODO NOTE The subscript operator is not symmetrical as in C. For example in C3 array[n] = 33 is allowed, but not n[array] = 33 . This is a change from C. Operands Compound Literals Compound literals have the format compound_literal ::= TYPE_IDENTIFIER '(' initializer_list ')' initializer_list ::= '{' (initializer_param (',' initializer_param)* ','?)?

Function calls Varargs For varargs, a bool or any integer smaller than what the C ABI specifies for the c int type is cast to int . Any float smaller than a double is cast to double .

All types are defined on a global level. Using the public prefix is necessary for any type that is to be exposed outside of the current module. Naming All user defined types in C3 starts with upper case. So MyStruct or Mystruct would be fine, mystruct_t or mystruct would not. Since this affects C compatibility, it is possible to use attributes to change the external name of a type: struct Stat @extname(\"stat\") { // ... } fn CInt stat(const char* pathname, Stat* buf); Differences from C Unlike C, C3 does not use type qualifiers. const exists, but is a storage class modifier, not a type qualifier. Instead of volatile , volatile loads and stores are used. In order to signal restrictions on variable usage, like const-ness preconditions are used. Basic types Basic types are divided into floating point types, and integer types. Integer types being either signed or unsigned. Integer types Name bit size signed bool* 1 no ichar 8 yes char 8 no short 16 yes ushort 16 no int 32 yes uint 32 no long 64 yes ulong 64 no iptr** varies yes uptr** varies no iptrdiff** varies yes uptrdiff** varies no isize** varies yes usize** varies no * bool will be stored as a byte. ** size, pointer and pointer sized types depend on platform. Integer arithmetics All signed integer arithmetics uses 2's complement. Integer constants Integer constants are 1293832 or -918212. Without a suffix, suffix type is assumed to the signed integer of arithmetic promotion width . Adding the u suffix gives a unsigned integer of the same width. Use ixx and uxx \u2013 where xx is the bitwidth for typed integers, e.g. 1234u16 Integers may be written in decimal, but also in binary with the prefix 0b e.g. 0b0101000111011 , 0b011 in octal with the prefix 0o e.g. 0o0770 , 0o12345670 in hexadecimal with the prefix 0x e.g. 0xdeadbeef 0x7f7f7f Furthermore, underscore _ may be used to add space between digits to improve readability e.g. 0xFFFF_1234_4511_0000 , 123_000_101_100 TwoCC, FourCC and EightCC FourCC codes are often used to identify binary format types. C3 adds direct support for 4 character codes, but also 2 and 8 characters: 2 character strings, e.g. 'C3' , would convert to an ushort or short. 4 character strings, e.g. 'TEST' , converts to an uint or int. 8 character strings, e.g. 'FOOBAR11' converts to an ulong or long. Conversion is always done so that the character string has the correct ordering in memory. This means that the same characters may have different integer values on different architectures due to endianess. Base64 and hex data literals Base64 encoded values work like TwoCC/FourCC/EightCC, in that is it laid out in byte order in memory. It uses the format b64'<base64>' . Hex encoded values work as base64 but with the format x'<hex>' . In data literals any whitespace is ignored, so '00 00 11'x encodes to the same value as x'000011' . In our case we could encode b64'Rk9PQkFSMTE=' as 'FOOBAR11' . Base64 and hex data literals initializes to arrays of the char type: char[*] hello_world_base64 = b64\"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh\"; char[*] hello_world_hex = x\"4865 6c6c 6f20 776f 726c 6421\"; String literals, multi-line and raw strings Regular string literals is text enclosed in \" ... \" just like in C. C3 also offers two other types of literals: multi-line strings and raw strings . Multi-line strings start and end with \"\"\" . Newline after the initial \"\"\" are removed, and so is a trailing new line on the last line before \"\"\" . Initial whitespace will be trimmed to the leftmost character in a line: char* foo = \"\"\" <html> <body> <p>Hello World</p> </body> </html> \"\"\"; // Same as: char* foo = \"<html>\\n\" \" <body>\\n\" \" <p>Hello World</p>\\n\" \" </body>\\n\" \"</html>\"; You can use \\| (escapes to a zero length string) and \\s (escapes to a space) to control the automatic trim: char* foo = \"\"\" \\| <body> \\| <p>Hello World</p> \\s \\| </body> \"\"\"; // Same as: char* foo = \" <body>\\n\" \" <p>Hello World</p> \\n\" \" </body>\"; Raw strings uses text between ` `. Inside of a raw string, no escapes are available. To write a ` double the character: char* foo = `C:\\foo\\bar.dll`; char* bar = `\"Say ``hello``\"`; // Same as char* foo = \"C:\\\\foo\\\\bar.dll\"; char* bar = \"\\\"Say `hello`\\\"\"; Floating point types Name alias bit size half* f16 16 float f32 32 double f64 64 quad* f128 128 *support depends on platform Floating point constants Floating point constants will at least use 64 bit precision. Just like for integer constants, it is allowed to use underscore, but it may not occur immediately before or after a dot or an exponential. Floating point values may be written in decimal or hexadecimal. For decimal, the exponential symbol is e (or E, both are acceptable), for hexadecimal p (or P) is used: -2.22e-21 -0x21.93p-10 It is possible to type a floating point by adding a suffix: Suffix type f16 float16 f32 or f float f64 double f128 float128 C compatibility For C compatibility the following types are also defined when including std::cinterop Name c type CChar char CShort short int CUShort unsigned short int CInt int CUInt unsigned int CLong long int CULong unsigned long int CLongLong long long CULongLong unsigned long long CFloat float CDouble double CLongDouble long double Note that signed C char and unsigned char will correspond to ichar and char . CChar is only available to match the default signedness of char on the platform. Pointer types Pointers mirror C: Foo* is a pointer to a Foo , while Foo** is a pointer to a pointer of Foo. Array types Arrays are indicated by [<size>] after the type, e.g. int[4] . Subarrays use the type[] . For initialization the wildcard type[*] can be used to infer the size from the initializer. See the chapter on arrays . Enum Enum (enumerated) types use the following syntax: enum State : int { PENDING = 0, RUNNING, TERMINATED } Enum constants are namespaces by default, just like C++'s class enums. So accessing the enums above would for example use State.PENDING rather than PENDING . Enum type inference When an enum is used in where the type can be inferred, like in case-clauses or in variable assignment, it is allowed to drop the enum name: State foo = PENDING; // State.PENDING is inferred. switch (foo) { case RUNNING: // State.RUNNING is inferred ... default: ... } fn void test(State s) { ... } ... test(RUNNING); // State.RUNNING is inferred In the case that it collides with a global in the same scope, it needs the qualifier: module test; fn void testState(State s) { ... } State RUNNING = State.TERMINATED; // Don't do this! ... test(RUNNING); // Ambiguous test(test::RUNNING); // Uses global. test(State.RUNNING); // Uses enum constant. Error Error types are similar to enums, and are used for error returns. errtype IOError; errtype ParseError { int line; int col; } The data inside of an error cannot exceed the size of an iptr that is pointer sized. An error is similar to a struct and is initialized the same way. One exception is that simple errors without a body does not need to be created using a () : return IOError!; return IOError({})!; // Same as above return ParseError({ line, col })!; In order to pass the error on the error side channel instead of as a value, the ! . Failable A failable is created by taking a type and appending ! . A failable is a tagged union containing either the given type or an error. int! i; i = 5; // Assigning a real value to i. i = IOError!; // Assigning an error to i. Only variables and return variables may be of the failable type. Function and macro parameters may not be failable types. fn Foo*! getFoo() { ... } // Ok! fn void processFoo(Foo*! f) { ... } // Error! int! x = 0; // Ok! Read more about the errors on the page about error handling . Struct types Structs are always named: struct Person { char age; char* name; } A struct's members may be accessed using dot notation, even for pointers to structs. Person p; p.age = 21; p.name = \"John Doe\"; io::printf(\"%s is %d years old.\", p.age, p.name); Person* pPtr = &p; pPtr.age = 20; // Ok! io::printf(\"%s is %d years old.\", pPtr.age, pPtr.name); (One might wonder whether it's possible to take a Person** and use dot access. \u2013 It's not, only one level of dereference is done.) Struct subtyping C3 allows creating struct subtypes: struct ImportantPerson { inline Person person; char* title; } fn printPerson(Person p) { io::printf(\"%s is %d years old.\", p.age, p.name); } ImportantPerson important_person; important_person.age = 25; important_person.name = \"Jane Doe\"; important_person.title = \"Rockstar\"; printPerson(important_person); // Only the first part of the struct is copied. Union types Union types are defined just like structs. union Integral { byte as_byte; short as_short; int as_int; long as_long; } As usual unions are used to hold one of many possible values: Integral i; i.as_byte = 40; // Setting the active member to as_byte i.as_int = 500; // Changing the active member to as_int // Undefined behaviour: as_byte is not the active member, // so this will probably print garbage. io.printf(\"%d\", i.as_byte); Note that unions only take up as much space as their largest member, so $sizeof(Integral) is equivalent to sizeof(long) . Anonymous sub-structs / unions Just like in later versions of C, anonymous sub-structs / unions are allowed. struct Person { char age; char* name; union { int employee_nr; uint other_nr; } union subname { bool b; Callback cb; } } Tagged unions In C, using structs with an enum value to indicate type is common practice. C3 also offers tagged unions, which is formalizing this within the language: TBD: Exact syntax (see the ideas page) Anonymous structs It's possible to use anonymous structs (structs without name) as arguments. These will only be checked for structural equivalence. NOTE: This syntax is not final. fn void set_coordinates(struct { int i; int j; } coord) { ... } struct Vec2 { int x; int y; } struct Vector { int px; int py; } struct Vec3 { int x; int y; int z; } fn void test() { Vec2 v2 = { 1, 2 }; Vector v = { 1, 4 }; Vec3 v3 = { 1, 2, 3 }; set_coordinates(v2); // valid set_coordinates(v); // valid set_coordinates(v3); // ERROR, no structural equivalence. struct { int i; int j; } xy = v2; v = (struct { int, int })v2; }","title":"Types"},{"location":"types/#types","text":"As usual, types are divided into basic types and user defined types (enum, union, struct, errtypes, aliases).
